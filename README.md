iBookWorm
=========

### Project Description:
iBookWorm is an iOS port of the BookWorm Appp I had created on android. This port will help me exhibit my understanding of the following things on iOS using swift:
- Swift proficiency.
- iOS SDK proficiency.
- JSON parsing.
- File IO.
- Persistence using Core Data.

This is a work in progress and I expect to update it frequently till it is completed.
